**What are some of the signs and causes of Callback Hell?**

 In a nested callbacks if one function has an error every function in the callback has an error. and often looks diffucult to ready.

**What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?**

Asynconous code run when the await function complete and in order, not simutaniously but continuously.

**Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix Callback Hell**

to can exscape CallbackHell you can use asyconous code to get a promise and an exscape que which can be denied or fulfilled.

**Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.**
