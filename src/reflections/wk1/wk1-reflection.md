**In your own words, why do we use Git?**

We use Git to track our progress as we code, and commit actions. Which can later be used to reload work if errors are unfixable.

**What are the benefits of having multiple branches?**

Having a different branch other than your main, allows you to continue on the project personally. While not affect the source code of the main branch, but can be merged later on.

**What is the difference between Git and GitHub**

Git is what we have on our computers and coding software, while GitHub is the cloud platform which holds stored data cimmited by Git.



**What is a Path and how are they used?**

A path is often a display of named folders on a computer, which are ordered from C hard-drive to any folder on the computer-> -> -> Paths are normally used to get to section folders we need to code in (Command Prompt) and edit without having to link folders everytime we pull up Visual Studio Code. 

**What CLI command would you use to see all files in your Current Working Directory (CWD), including those that start with a '.'**

'ls' Is the command to display all folders within CWD, but having 'ls -a' will display all including '.' folders.

**How can a user retrieve files deleted by the rm command?**

Unforunetly there is no way to retreive these files after they are deleted by the rm command.

**What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use**

I personally like the :hover feature, because i like to make my buttons more visually interactable. Changing their color when the mouse hovers over it.

**What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?**

Specificity is used in CSS, and is like a priorty selector for classes and id ran in CSS. I can have a player set to be green as default, but lets say you 'leveled up' but your still a player. I can add classes to change like player.lvl2{blue} in order to get a high Specificity.

**What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?**

Using the player understanding, if i gave player !important, then player.lvl2 would include player, but instead they'll still be green due to !important.

**What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?**

Bootstrap all the way, but also coding with the icon > to create childern within parental divs. while giving .classes and *multiplicity.

**Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.**

Don't use borders, but use border-radius to round containers. Also use box-shadows to make containers 'pop' out presentably.

**How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?**

Good design is important because allot on cnatiners and basic appeals can be over-whelming or just plain scetchy. having good design on your webpage can make the user experiance more appealing.

**What does the align self CSS rule do?**

align-self can manage over justify-content. by using align-self you can move a section of content, after being adjusted by justify-content.

**When you are building out your HTML page, what is the default display type of your elements?**

the default display type in flex-start. or left to right.



**What is the purpose of wire-framing?**

To set a a mental projection for how you visually want to make your webpage look like, then quickly draw it out.

**What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?**

three types: low-fidelity, mid-fidelity, and high-fidelity. main differentce is the amount of time and detail the fidelities have.

**Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?**

Yes, doing a easy quick sketch can let you eyeball and guesstimate the columns need to format the pages. But for the other fidelities I dont feel their nessisary for it is the progress made after the first hand-drawn fidelity.
