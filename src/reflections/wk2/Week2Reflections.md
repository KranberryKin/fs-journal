**What is Scope ?**

Scope is where a variable can be used. Specifically if a variable is set inside a function. Its variable is not accessable outside itself, unlike setting global scoped variables in the Main JS screen.

**What is Hoisting ?**

Hoisting is setting the variable globally in the code as it initiates. This is due to running code top to bottum, and variables are scoped if placed within functions.

**In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?**

'Var' is the default variable setting command for global variables, and can be updated and changed. 'let' is setting the 'temporary' vaule. 'let' is bound withing the function it's in, and can be updated not changed. 'const' is simular, but instead it remains a constant value that cannot be changed or updated.

**What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?**

'for()' functions are loops, and they can access and either check or updated arrays and dictionaries. While 'if()' functions are like a boleen function and run if it is true, but if added with 'else{}' it can run another action on false. Lastly 'switch(value)' functions is like checking a fileing cabnet. It takes in a value (which is data-type sensitive to cases) and compares it to the values of each "case 'value':" it contains. If one matchs it run code underneath the case, and can be called off with break;. But Deafault is needed with 'switch()' function to run, if there are no cases that match.

**What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?**

Parameters are set values that are needed in functions, and are placed within their '()'. Arguments are the values or the paremeters being taken in, and or used to run said functions. If parameters are needed to do so that is.

**What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?**

A function with no parameters is the default, or has low order in functions. When you add parameters to a function, then it becomes of higher order. It requires more values, in order to run said function.

**What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.**

Lets just say you made a function, and you want to test it. You can write to the console within the function with a console.log("statement"), then you can run the function and see if it works. But if you want to test a function that changes or manipulates values, you can write to the console with a return 'value'. but using return stops the function then and there!

**Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?**

Depends is if a website and you want to see it's layout, or you want to see your local host and changed values there temporaraly. On any website right click and hit inspect, then go and click on the tab Elements. Here you can temporaraly add and removed changes to the html without affecting your code. If page refreshs all changes lost. The Css is on the right while you are on the Elements Tab.

**Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?**

The better way to debug your code, would be to constantly test and run your code while you are making it. So when you are do run into issues, you can be directed to it instead of having broken code. While having DevTools open, you can run your code with breakpoint and check values. In order to see if they are undefined, and causing your function to not work.

**What are regular expressions or regex?**

Regular expressions are values that are set to test string data. Also regex can verify whole or parts of strings.

**Give an example of where a regex could in an application.**

Using regular expressions you can test /^\d{10}$/ to match beginning and end of a string, up to 10 digits will return true, but exceeding digits it will return false. 

**Give an example of a regex expression that would match an email address.**

While using the following expression above, you can add periods(.) within and a \/d{3}$/ to match end of email. clarifying it's at least .com, .gov, or .net.

**What is the difference between a Constructor in comparison to a regular Function?**

Both functions run the code within them. But constructor functions are different by capatalizing the first letter of the function. Also when using them, you can set parameters of data which if needed to create an object. 

**What is a prototype?**

Prototype is a vaule you set saying, that this value before itself can differ. But after itself it remains the same. 

**What is inheritance and how can it be used?**

Inheritance is bringing an value in and making it work, by using a prototype. So therefor  a function can be ran with multiple inheritable values.

**What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?**

When you make a plan, you can set up a visual idea and broad plan of an outline for your webpage. then you can trial and error to make your plan. If you start right away without an outline you can make technical errors, and not have this visually display the way you want them too.

**How do you find answers when you are stuck?**

Create a to do list of what you need to get done. whats first, the outline of the webpage. or the templates of whats going to change on the webpage. If you are working front end or back end, the questions very. If you know what you want your website to do, create all the functions that you would need done definitivly.

**From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?**

Commit and commit often. Everytime you commit you have more source control over your data. If you make a mistake and break the page, go back a commit! The more you commit, the more backup data and foudnation you have for yourself.
