**What is Scope ?**

Scope is where a variable can be used. Specifically if a variable is set inside a function, its variable is not accessable outside of the function.

**What is Hoisting ?**

Hoisting is setting the variable above all the code before it initiates. This is due to running code top to bottum and running variables which are not set if place undernedth functions.

**In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?**

Var is the default variable setting command. let is the updated 'temporary' vaule. let is bound to the {} it's within. Same goes for const, but instead this remains a constant value and isn't changed.
