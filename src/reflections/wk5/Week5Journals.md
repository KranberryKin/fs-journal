**What is the purpose of a Query String?**

A Query String is a unit where information is stored by a website, using the string which is added to the end of a url to access and store the Query String.

**What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?**

A query parameter starts whit a question mark (?). The distingguishable part between them, is that one is bracket notation([]). Which turns phrase the notation as an object({}). As for the other parmeter you use the 'and' symbol(&). It creates the phrase as an property array if so desired(color=[]).

**When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?**

When I want to create allot objects with properties as data for an api, or when I want to create an array of potential strings/numbers.

**What are the three types of relationships?**

1: One to One Relationship
2: One to Many Relationship
3: Many to Many Relationship

**What are the benefits of the traditional linking of relationships instead of Embedding**

Traditional linkings can and will always return a value, but if you embed propterties. Then you have to dig into the embeddment, and access the properties.

**What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?**

The main issue with many-to-many relationships, is that when adding information to a section you can easily run out of data. There can be multiple items with the same catagory. But if we had every catagory in the books that are being added to that catagory, will use allot more data than intended and/or needed.
