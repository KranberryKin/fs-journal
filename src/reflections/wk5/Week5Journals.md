**What is the purpose of a Query String?**

A Query String is a unit where information is stored by a website, using the string which is added to the end of a url to access and store the Query String.

**What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?**

A query parameter starts whit a question mark (?). The distingguishable part between them, is that one is bracket notation([]). Which turns phrase the notation as an object({}). As for the other parmeter you use the 'and' symbol(&). It creates the phrase as an property array if so desired(color=[]).

**When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?**

When I want to create allot objects with properties as data for an api, or when I want to create an array of potential strings/numbers.
