**Mondays' Reflection**

Having only half of my server side done after weekend wasn't my plan. I started running my postman tests after completing and mis-preceived my try catch errors. spent all day moving tests and throw errors to the controller.

**Tuesdays' Reflection**

Trying to tackle the postman tests again I realized all my catches in my controllers didn't return bad request, they threw new exception which is why the postmans failed. Spent most of today undoing allot of yesterdays work and got all the postman tests working. Also started on front end!

**Wedsnesdays' Reflection**

I didn't realize how behind I was in other catagories of work, so i spent the morning catching up on my resume and carreer work. Then  started working on getting the keeps drawn to the homescreen. when you click on them they open their modal. and in the modal when you click the profile icon takes you to their page!! keeps also load for profile page :>
