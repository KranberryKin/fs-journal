**What technologies and principles are you using in your project?**

Focusing on SOLID pricinicples and making sure each function does it's own action, calling other functions to not have repeatitive code.

**What went well so far?**

All functionallity for the server and front end connections have been fully successful. No problems when running postman tests.

**What would you do differently? Why?**

I would have helped and focused more on the main Map Api, which my team was using earlier in development. We came to find out in the second week, the api we wanted to use was not functional for receiving data. Had to switch map api's and learn something new , than felt like I would get in the way when two people were focusing on the last thing that needed to get done.

**What is a Github action and how do they work?**

A Github action can be called a Workflow. Reacting pushes to an repository, and/or making pull requests and forks from Github. When these actions react they can run a set amount of tests which can run on almost any platform.

**What benefits do Github actions provide?**

It seems to be able to set up a form of data or documentaion when a page is loaded or forked. Leaving context for the user obtaining the information. And/Or making a template from a repository. 

**What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?**

Workflows, Scheduled, Webhooks, and external are different triggering actions. Each can run a 'job' in a workflow, and run only if certain conditions are met. Like run another function after 1st one created an object/template.

**How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?**

When implementing scrum on larger team, you have more people who may work on specific parts of an project during a sprint. Possibly causing confliction, unless team manages best way to divide and conjour. Smaller teams can poitentially assign tasts quicker, but may not have as much planned progress for a sprint.

**Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.**

1 sprint is an accumulation of previous sprints, and the amount of work and time went into said sprint. Scrum prescribes one sprint at a time because, it's a set amount of work and a set amount of time the team needs to finish said work.

**What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?**

I can't help but to feel Scrum was made to avoid the unattainable triangle, because every webpage of software a bussiness wants made, they want it made as fast and cheap as possible. But of course want good quality work too. Whats the best way to purpose and offer and a set payment while being negotiable.

**What is an SSL certificate?**

SSL is a Secure Sockets Layer, a file of computed code to encrypt personal data.

**What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?**

When you have a SSL certificate, you can get a 'boost' in approval by a google search. Only because you site is protected over others, potentially bringing in more customers.
