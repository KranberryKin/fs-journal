**What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?**

Pair Programming is when two people are working together on one computer. While one partner is on the computer, they are the Driver/coder. The other partner is the Navagator, and tells the driver what to work on next. 

**What are some benefits of Pair Programming?**

When working in pairs, the amount of time spent working on project is decreased. Over time, results show increase in time effectivness. Also an decrease of confusion amoung the teams information.

**What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?**

When working in pairs, the best relation can't be forced upon someone. Both partners in the project we to work together on tasks, or little to no benifit is gained.

**What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?**

Code Documentation is when you create function for yourself to have reusable functions. When you have code Documentation, there can be readme on howto use your code. Also good to have the code documented on a source.

**What are some benefits of Code Documentation?**

Using Code Documentaion can help organize your data and make it more readable. When good code should speak for itself, and be readable at least understandable.

**How important is Code documentation and why?**

When you don't have code documentaion. You don't have anything to reference when you or a colleuge get back to it. How will you know what does what and where information flow goes? Having code documentation eliminates this problem if done propurely.

**What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?**

User experience is litterally everything the user Could potentially experience on the webpage. Should be considered despite websites functionallity, so any user can have the best experience wherever they are. 

**What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?**

When you have good user experiance, the users may come back to your website due to the functionallity and good user interface interaction.

**Why is the User Experience important?**

When you are a programmer and you create websites for users. When having good code and keeping User Experiance in mind. Once using your project, they may want to stay customers if the interface loads pleasingly. 

**Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?**

I really focus on making my code readable. I personally like naming things and functions as they are for it makes my coding and revising much mroe easier and pleasing. 

**What went well?**

When finished with the back end of out partner project, we were able to see how benifitial it is to working together and guiding one another. less errors due to corrections, while confusing was still there at times. It wasn't terriable.

**What would you do differently?**

I would have read my daily journals and focused more on group efforts and driver and navagator roles sooner.
